        <h2>Loaded Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Bark</h2>
        <p>This Loaded Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup Bark is BURSTING with the perfect flavor combo, but it’s a bark, so it’s way easy!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ol>
            <ul>3 1/2 cups of chocolate chips (I used milk chocolate), divided</ul>
            <ul>1 1/2 cups of creamy peanut butter (I used JIF)</ul>
            <ul>1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar</ul>
            <ul>3 TBSPs butter, softened</ul>
            <ul>1 cup Reese's Pieces</ul>
        </ol>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a 10 by 15 inch pan with wax paper.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 1/2 cups of the chocolate and spread it over the wax paper. It won't reach all the way to the edge of the pan. Put it in the refrigerator to set.</li>
            <li>Combine the peanut butter, powdered sugar, and butter. I put mine in the microwave during mixing for 10 to 15 seconds to help with mixing. Spread it over the chocolate layer evenly.</li>
            <li>Put the pan back in the refrigerator to set.</li>
            <li>Melt the remaining 2 cups chocolate chips and then spread over the peanut butter layer. Top with the Reese's Pieces. Let set and then break apart. Store in an airtight container.</li>
